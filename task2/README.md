Implement Animated sorting application. 

Application should:
    - Implement the following sorting algorithms:
        1. Bubble sort
        2. Quick sort
        3. Insertions sort
        4. Merge sort
        5. Shell sort
    - Have control to input an array of integers or provide a file with an array.
    - Save the result to output file.
    - Ability to generate an array of integers.
    - Give an ability to choose the desired sort algorithm.
    - Make a visualization of sort algorithm (for instance: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Sorting_gnomesort_anim.gif)
    - Controls to set visualization speed
    - Controls to start/pause/resume/stop visualization
    - Ability to save image with sorted and unsorted array. (also picture may be saved as animated gif).
    - Documentation: requirements specification, software design documentation (application modules description, UML diagrams).
